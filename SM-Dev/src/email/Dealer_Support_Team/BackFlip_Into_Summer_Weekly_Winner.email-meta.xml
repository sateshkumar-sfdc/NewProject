Congratulations! You were one of the top 3 YETI sales associates in your entire territory this week!

As a prize, you’ll receive $75 + free shipping toward your next purchase on YETI.com.


A few important details about redeeming your prize:

- Here is your discount code: (enter discount code here)

- It’s a one-time use code redeemable solely on YETI.com. Your code expires on July 31, 2018.

- Exclusions Apply. Code is not applicable to the Hondo, Hondo accessories, licensed or custom products.

- Be sure to use the entire $75 on your purchase, as the amount cannot be spread out over multiple purchases. (i.e. If you use the discount code to purchase a Rambler for $34.99, your discount code is used. You will not have the balance leftover to use on a future purchase.) Moral of the story – make sure your purchase is at least $75 when you checkout to maximize your discount.

-    Lastly, YETI.com currently cannot process an order that totals $0. After applying your discount code, be sure your order total is greater than $0 to avoid any processing issues.



To use your code:

- Login to your account on YETI.com

- Add all desired items to your cart

- Click on “Cart” in the upper left hand corner, and select View Cart.

- In the Promo Code field, enter your discount code and hit Apply.

- Once your see your discount applied correctly, hit Checkout to complete your purchase.

- If you have any questions while placing an order, please reach out to the Outfitter team at 512-394-9384 or customerservice@yeti.com.



Congrats, again! We know you’ll love your new YETI.
