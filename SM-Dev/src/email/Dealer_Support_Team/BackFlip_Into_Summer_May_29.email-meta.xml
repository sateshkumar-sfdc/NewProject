    <textOnly>Picture yourself fishing off the coast of Florida, gator hunting in Louisiana, or getting up close and personal to the action at the Professional Bull Riding series. Sounds fun, right?

You’re halfway through the BackFlip Into Summer Sales Contest. Nice job so far! Whether you’re aiming to win the weekly $75 prize, or have your sights set on the grand prize adventure trip, we hope you’re having fun (and selling YETI like crazy!).

To get you over that mid-contest hump, get inspired by watching a few YETI Presents films.

- If you love fishing

- Hunting is your thing

- Or maybe skiing

- Or ranching

- Or surfing

Whatever your wild is, there’s a YETI for that. That’s true for your customer as well. Try using a personal experience with your YETI this week to authentically share why you believe in YETI.

As always, reach out to (insert TSM name) or me with any questions.

Best of luck in week 4!

P.S. - As a reminder, all sales from the 3rd week of the contest must be submitted via the linked form below by 4pm CT today, May 29, to be eligible for this week’s prize: https://yeti.formstack.com/forms/backflip_into_summer

If one of your sales associates wins a weekly prize, they will be notified directly by email.

Terms and conditions apply. See full contest rules here.
