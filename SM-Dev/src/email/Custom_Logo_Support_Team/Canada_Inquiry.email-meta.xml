    <textOnly>Hi ,



Thank you for your email! Currently YETI products can be purchased to be shipped to Canada on our international site here:



https://intl.yeti.com/



We are working to expand our offerings to include the ability to send customized orders internationally but at this time we aren&apos;t able to ship any YETI Custom Shop orders outside of the United States.



We hope that we can work together in the future on customized product. Thank you for your interest!


Thanks,
