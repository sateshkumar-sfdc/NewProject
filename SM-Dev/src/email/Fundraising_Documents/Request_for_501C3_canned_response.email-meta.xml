    <textOnly>Greetings,



Thank you for reaching out to YETI Coolers. I have reviewed your documents and they look great.  We are just missing a copy of the original IRS 501C3 letter that designates the organization a nonprofit, or in some cases your state tax exemption documents. I have attached a sample of the IRS letter so you can see what to look for. You can reply to this email with your document.



Sincerely,
