    <textOnly>We’re two weeks out from Father’s Day, which, around YETI, is like saying we’re two weeks out from the Holidays.

It’s historically the busiest selling season for YETI of the entire year, rivaled only by the Holidays. Which means it’s the best time of year to take advantage of being a YETI Authorized Dealer. Now is the time to make sure you’re firing on all cylinders:


- Your shelves are full and your display is top-notch.

o Need to place a re-order? Reach out to (insert TSM name) or me.


- Your staff is trained and excited about the YETI brand and products.

o As a reminder, you can download training videos here.

o Or take a few training modules on Experticity.


- You’re sharing your status as a YETI Authorized Dealer on social media and in your local media.

o We want everyone to know you’re the go-to place for YETI!

o Be sure to tag your posts with #BackFlipIntoSummer



There are two weeks left in the contest, so make the most of it!

P.S. - As a reminder, all sales from the 4th week of the contest must be submitted via the linked form below by 4pm CT today, June 4, to be eligible for this week’s prize: https://yeti.formstack.com/forms/backflip_into_summer

If one of your sales associates wins a weekly prize, they will be notified directly by email.
