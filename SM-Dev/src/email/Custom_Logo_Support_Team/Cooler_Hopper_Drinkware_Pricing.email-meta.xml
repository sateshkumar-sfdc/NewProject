    <textOnly>Thank you for reaching out to YETI and requesting a custom quote! YETI is proud to offer an exciting opportunity for corporate entities. We have a bulk discount structure that will offer in-stock items to qualifying organizations for corporate or client gifting.

YETI CUSTOM DRINKWARE PROGRAM DETAILS:

Please see the attached price sheet for our customized Rambler corporate pricing*. Unit pricing for single logo customization is located on the second page along with order increments. Typical turnaround time is about 2-3 weeks** after your order has been confirmed which includes artwork approval and receipt of payment. The order will ship free of charge via standard FedEx ground.

We are currently waiving the $10 customization fee on single-sided logo&apos;d Ramblers. Double-sided marking is available, please contact us for details. Currently, we cannot produce color logos on our drinkware. Our stainless-steel drinkware is laser-marked to produce a permanent black logo with a matte black finish. On our DuraCoat drinkware, an ablation process removes the paint coating to reveal the logo on the underlying stainless steel.

We are currently sold out of DuraCoat colors so we will only be able to place orders for stainless steel Ramblers at this time.

We will provide a virtual proof for approval before orders are processed. Below are links to examples of printable areas on each product we offer:

Printable Rambler Tumbler Areas
Printable Rambler Bottle Areas

* Customized Ramblers must be ordered in case quantity to qualify for corporate pricing.

YETI CUSTOM COOLER PROGRAM DETAILS:

A YETI Cooler with your custom logo applied is the ultimate way to promote your brand as well as reward or thank employees or customers.  YETI custom logos are durable, permanent graphics which will not peel or fade once bonded to the cooler. Details about our cooler program are below:

•    Available sizes are the Roadie 20 up to the Tundra 65 and Tank 85
•    Initial minimum order is $5,000 with minimum reorder of $3,000

•    Typical lead time is eight weeks**

Please see the attached price sheet for customized cooler corporate pricing.

YETI HOPPER DETAILS:

At this time, we do not customize Hoppers. Hoppers do have a spot where you can attach a 2” x 3” hook and loop Velcro patch if you were to get some custom patches made.

We do offer tiered pricing on corporate Hopper orders; please see the price sheet attached. This pricing applies only for orders that are not for resale. The attached certified form must be signed and returned before we can place your order.

HOW TO ORDER:

After reviewing the attached pricing brochures, please confirm the details of your quote request below:

1. Shipping &amp; Billing address(es)

2. Cooler or Rambler size, color, and quantity of each product

3. Your desired logo if you have not already submitted them

For custom cooler orders, please send an EPS, AI file, or JPG/PDF file
