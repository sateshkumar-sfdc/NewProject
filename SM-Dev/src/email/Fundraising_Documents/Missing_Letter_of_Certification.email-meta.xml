    <textOnly>Greetings,



Thank you for reaching out to YETI Coolers.  I have reviewed your documents and they look great.  We are just missing a copy of the Letter of Certification.  I have attached a copy of the document for easy access. You can reply to this email with your document.




I look forward to working with you.


Sincerely,
